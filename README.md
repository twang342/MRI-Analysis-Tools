# MRI-Analysis-Tools-for-Localized-Tumor-Enhancement

MRI Analysis Tools for T1-weighted tumor images on mice. Uses Horos, ImageJ, and MATLAB. 

Example: T1-weighted MRI of subcutaneous tumors on mice, 5 hrs post-adminstration with Gd-EOB-DTPA agent. Bright regions represents intratumorally injected cells.

Steps:
1. Read instructions on PDF file.
2. Can be used to generate intensity profiles which map pixel values on a plane drawn across tumor.
3. Can be used to count "bright" pixels above calculated thresholds over entire tumor pre- and post-contrast enhancement.
